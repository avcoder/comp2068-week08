# Quick midterm review

## Create custom method in model

# Passport Authentication

1.  Create link in nav called "Register"
1.  Create blank register.ejs page
1.  Create link in nav called "Login"
1.  Create blank login.ejs page

We'll now need to install some passport packages, then configure them in app.js
Then we'll need to deal with forms in register and login pages.
Once we can do that, we'll make changes to admin page - add conditional logic so that admin/add is hidden unless logged in
